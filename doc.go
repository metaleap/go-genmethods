// Package gent offers a _Golang code-**gen t**oolkit_; philosophy being:
//
// - _"your package's type-defs. your pluggable custom code-gen logics (+ many built-in ones), tuned via your struct-field tags. one `go generate` call."_
//
// The design idea is that your codegen programs remains your own `main`
// packages written by you, but importing `gent` keeps them short and
// high-level: fast and simple to write, iterate, maintain over time.
//
// Very WIP: more comprehensive readme / package docs to come.
